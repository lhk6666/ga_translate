# Documentation

[üáØüáµ Japanese version](./README.jp.md)

Every member in the DRAGON Lab has created a lot of documents.
However, it is still difficult to find a document when you want it, because the entry of every document is sometimes too deep.

Here we hope to create an entry page to store all the documents. This page should contain many links and perform as a table of content.
We hope you can also contribute to it when creating a useful document. 

[The README for the lab page can be found here](./docs/Lab_Page_README.md).

# Initial Entry

## Join the lab

Welcome to the DRAGON Lab! We are glad to have you here. Here are some things you need to know:

For anything related to your life, e.g., residence card, bank account, phone number, please consult your tutor.

- We use Google Workspace to manage the lab. Every member has a Google account with the domain `dragon.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp`.
So please ask some members, e.g., Jinjie, to create an account for you.

- We use Slack for communication. After creating an account, please ask some members to invite you join the slack. The slack stores all the history messages and files. You can search for any information you want.

- We use Google Drive to store all the files. You should have permissions to visit all files once you have created a Google account. The files are classified into different folders.

- We use Google Photos to store all the experiment photos and videos.

- We use Google Calendar to schedule events. Once you have your DRAGON account, the [DRAGON Lab calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_d2866224878618cf1af00d5b999561e0ce40f6126b1c2432e80d5389224e0b58%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Asia%2FTokyo) should be added automatically. Another important calendar is [0066 Reservations](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_d2866224878618cf1af00d5b999561e0ce40f6126b1c2432e80d5389224e0b58%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Asia%2FTokyo), we use it to manage the experiment time for 0066. Finally, it's recommanded to add UTAS calendar for your courses, which can be downloaded from UTAS website: UTAS -> Schedule -> Calendar Link.

- We use GitHub to store all the code. The GitHub account is independent of the Google account. You can use your own GitHub account or create one.
After creating an account, please ask some members to invite you to join the GitHub organization: [https://github.com/ut-dragon-lab](https://github.com/ut-dragon-lab).
Currently, we have two major repositories: [https://github.com/jsk-ros-pkg/jsk_aerial_robot](https://github.com/jsk-ros-pkg/jsk_aerial_robot) and [https://github.com/ut-dragon-lab/dragon_lab_page](https://github.com/ut-dragon-lab/dragon_lab_page). 
The former is for the code and the latter is for the website & documents.

- Finally, don't forget to update your information on the lab website! Please read the [README.md](./docs/Lab_Page_README.md) of this repository, and refer to other members' pages to create your own one.
After creating your page, please read [How to contribute to this document](#how-to-contribute-to-this-document) in this page. After your PR is merged, your information will be shown on [this page](http://www.dragon.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/team/).

The default password for all ubuntu systems: leus.
